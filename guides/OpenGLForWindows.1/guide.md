# What is OpenGL?

OpenGL is short for Open Graphics Library. This means it provides a set of tools which allow you to display 2D and 3D images to your screen, a process called *rendering*. It is useful because the rendering is typically "hardware accelerated", meaning that the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) is automatically used to make rendering much faster that it would be otherwise. OpenGL is also useful because it works on a variety of platforms, unlike other graphics libraries such as Metal or Direct3D. OpenGL is considered to be a good starting point for someone new to graphics programming, as there are an immense number of resources available for learners.
